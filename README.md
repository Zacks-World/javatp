### Introduction

Arrays and strings are core data structures in programming, especially in object-oriented languages like Java. Arrays offer a way to store multiple elements of the same type efficiently, which makes them ideal for tasks like sorting, searching, and calculating statistics. In Java, arrays are objects that can hold either primitive data types or object references, adding flexibility to their applications.

Strings, meanwhile, represent sequences of characters and are crucial for managing text data. Java strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered after creation, which helps secure data but also presents unique challenges for manipulation. Common operations with strings include concatenation, substring searches, reversing characters, and word counting.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
In this exercise, we’ll create a Java program that lets users enter student grades, sort them, and compute valuable statistics, such as the average grade, highest and lowest grades, and the count of students who achieved a specific grade.

#### Question 1
we ask the user to input the number of students and their grades. Then, it uses Arrays.sort() to arrange the grades in ascending order and displays them.

#### Question 2
The highest and lowest grades are determined by comparing all the grades to find the maximum and minimum values

#### Question 3
The program calculates the average grade by summing all the grades and dividing by the number of students.

#### Question 4
The user can enter a grade, and the program counts how many students received that grade.

### Exercise 2
This exercise involves creating a Java program to conjugate regular French verbs in the first group . The program checks if the verb is in this group and conjugates it for all singular and plural pronouns.

The program prompts the user for a verb and verifies if it belongs to the first group. If valid, the program combines the verb root with the correct endings for each pronoun.

### Exercise 3
This exercise features a Java program with a menu allowing us to enter a string, display it, reverse it, or count the number of words.

The program shows a menu with options for string manipulations.

#### Entering(Choice1)
The User enter a String to the program

#### Showing(Choice2)
The program show the String to the user

#### Reversing(Choice3)
We reverse the string by puting the last element in the the place of the first  .

#### Counting (Choice4)
The program counts the words by splitting the string based on spaces and outputs the total word count.

### Exercise 4
In this exercise, the program counts each letter's occurrences in a user-provided string. The string is converted to lowercase to ensure accurate counting.

#### Counting the Letters
The program iterates through the string and tracks the occurrences of each letter.

#### Displaying Results
After processing, it displays the frequency of each letter present in the string.

### Conclusion
This lab covered essential concepts in arrays and strings within Java. Through various exercises—such as sorting grades, manipulating strings, and counting letter frequencies—we demonstrated how these data structures are powerful tools for developing efficient Java applications.
