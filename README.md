# TP1 : Arrays and Strings

This repository contains four Java exercises that explore foundational programming concepts, including student grade management, conjugation of first-group French verbs, string manipulation, and letter frequency analysis. Each exercise includes code examples and explanations to help solidify your understanding of these tasks.

## Overview
This project delves into Java-based implementations of arrays and strings. The exercises demonstrate how to handle student grades, conjugate French verbs, manipulate strings, and count letter occurrences, providing practical applications of these data structures.

### Introduction

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures in programming, especially in Java. Arrays enable efficient data storage and manipulation, commonly used in sorting, searching, and performing statistical operations. Java arrays can hold either primitive data types or references to objects, which makes them versatile.

Strings represent sequences of characters and are essential for managing text-based data. In Java, strings are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be changed. This immutability provides security benefits, though it can require alternative methods when handling them. Common operations on strings include concatenation, substring searching, character reversal, and word counting.

Mastering these structures is essential for solving various programming challenges. This lab covers exercises demonstrating the power and flexibility of arrays and strings in Java.
